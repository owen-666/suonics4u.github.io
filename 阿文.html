	<li>The Great Wall</li>
	<p2>(The Great Wall)The history of the construction of the great wall can be traced back to the Western Zhou Dynasty, from which the famous allusion "the warlords of beacon fire drama" took place in the capital city of Haojing (now Xi'an, Shaanxi Province). During the spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, countries fought for hegemony and defended each other. The construction of the Great Wall entered the first climax, but the length of the construction was relatively short at this time. After Qin destroyed the six countries and unified the world, Qin Shihuang connected and repaired the great wall of the Warring States period, which was called the great wall.</p2>
